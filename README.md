# benchmark

pip install numpy, pip install timeit and pip install simpy modules before running scripts. 

test_1.py is the base file that allows a specific value for each constant to be input (recommended to be used on smaller PC's where CPU overload is a possibility) and is set up for the 4 core processor tests. 

varying constants p and l will vary the number of parallel and linear models ran respectively, in test_1.py l can be varied infinitely and p values range from 1 to 10

test_2.py runs between 55 and 75 processes in parallel and therefore p values range from 55 and 75, linear values l is again unlimited
